Quite useful when using \r\n`reveal.js` to give a live lecture or when you are using `reveal.js` to record a lecture using a tool like \r\n<a href=\"https://www.techsmith.com/camtasia.html\" target=\"_blank\">Camtasia</a>.\r\n\r\nThis is a bit of code that builds on the excellent `sketch.js` library that implements a simple sketching tool\r\nusing jQuery and the HTML5 canvas:\r\n\r\nhttp://intridea.github.io/sketch.js/\r\n\r\nI mimic the UI and keystrokes of the OmniDazzle drawing tool that worked so well but was not compatible with MacOS versions\r\nbeyond 10.8 :(. You add dazzleSketch to a web page using the following pattern:\r\n\r\n    <html lang=\"en\">\r\n    <body>\r\n        <h1>This is a Header</h1>\r\n        <p>This is a paragraph that we will scribble on.</p>\r\n        <script src=\"https://ajax.googleapis.com/ajax/libs/jquery/2.1.3/jquery.min.js\"></script>\r\n        <script src=\"http://intridea.github.io/sketch.js/lib/sketch.js\"></script>\r\n        <script src=\"dazzleSketch.js\"></script>\r\n    </body>\r\n    </html>\r\n\r\nThis also works well when added to the reveal.js HTML.  I would like to see it turned into a plugin for \r\n`reveal.js` - but I am sure it needs a bit of code review.\r\n\r\nWhen dazzleSketch is loaded, you see no UI on the screen - it is just ready to scribble and \r\nactivated using the following keystrokes.\r\n\r\n* ctrl-` (next to the 1) erase and turn off drawing\r\n* ctrl-1 Yellow Pen\r\n* ctrl-2 Green Pen\r\n* ctrl-3 Cyan Pen\r\n* ctrl-4 Red Pen\r\n* ctrl-5 White Pen\r\n* ctrl-6 Blue Pen\r\n* ctrl-7 Magenta Pen\r\n* ctrl-8 Black Pen\r\n* ctrl-- Make pen narrower\r\n* ctrl-= Make pen wider\r\n\r\nWhile you are scribbling most mouse movements will be taken over by dazzleSketch.  If you hover over a link, the \r\na:hover action will not happen and you might not be able to click on a link in the HTML document until you \r\nclear the sketch overlay with ctrl-`.  This is because dazzleSketch makes an HTML5 canvas that covers \r\nthe entire window area and uses z-index to be \"on top\" of the other HTML content on the page.   When you clear \r\nthe screen, the dazzleSketch canvas is placed behind the rest of the content using z-index \r\nso all the normal mouse movements apply to the web content.\r\n\r\nFor me, I have a <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00115OFJK/ref=as_li_tl?ie=UTF8&camp=1789&creative=390957&creativeASIN=B00115OFJK&linkCode=as2&tag=drchu02-20&linkId=VKON6Z2MQ3TLWN6S\">Wacom Cintiq 12WX 12-Inch Pen Display</a><img src=\"http://ir-na.amazon-adsystem.com/e/ir?t=drchu02-20&l=as2&o=1&a=B00115OFJK\" width=\"1\" height=\"1\" border=\"0\" alt=\"\" style=\"border:none !important; margin:0px !important;\" />\r\nthat I remap the keys to make the drawing very smooth for nice drawings while recording lectures for \r\nmy online classes.\r\n\r\n\r\n \r\n","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
